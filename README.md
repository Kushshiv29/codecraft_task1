📊 Task 01 - Data Visualization with Bar Chart or Histogram
In this task, we aim to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram. This helps in understanding population-related patterns such as:

Gender distribution

Age distribution

Total population trends across countries or years

✅ Objective:
Create clear and insightful visualizations using real-world data to explore and present the distribution of a chosen variable.

📌 Sample Dataset:
We used population data from the World Bank:
🔗 World Bank Population Dataset

📈 Tools & Libraries:
Python 🐍

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

📊 Output:
Visualizations like:

Bar chart showing population by country/year

Histogram showing distribution of population values
